# Visualizing Urban Areas: Unlocking special properties for smart residential real estate choices

## Project Goal and Vision: 

Divide the city into meaningful districts taking into account nearby restaurants, business centers, residential buildings etc. Look at the intersections of these neighborhoods and show for what purposes which place in the city to choose. Also, we will include the weather conditions like air pollution. All this information will be useful for different purposes of living(travelling, working travel, future living etc).
